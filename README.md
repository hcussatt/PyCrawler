PyCrawler is a dungeon crawling role playing game developed entirely in the default python programming language, only making use of built in libraries and functions.
PyCrawler generates randomized dungeon layouts for each play through, along with allowing for randomized encounters with various types of enemies. PyCrawler has an inventory system that allows for any combination of three potion types, which can be purchased from a shop with the coins the player acquires throughout the game. The player's objective is to descend to the bottom of the dungeon, reaching the staircase on each floor. The player must then defeat the final boss to win the game. During combat, the player can use a variety of different actions in order to swiftly defeat enemies. These actions include attacking, defending, running, and using an item. If the player's health reaches zero, then the game is ended and the player is returned to the title screen. 

The game’s map system is generated through the use of a matrix determining which “tile” should be printed in what location, allowing for complex randomization of layouts, and scalability for more tiles to be added. Each floor produces a random floor layout, with stairs being moved far enough away from the player to keep a challenge. 

During combat, the player can face three different enemy types, each having different stats. These encounters are randomized, creating a risk/reward system of traveling across each floor. During combat, the player has the ability to attack an enemy for a range of damage, defend against an attack, use an item from their inventory, or attempt to flee. The inventory can contain three items and can be any assortment of potions.
